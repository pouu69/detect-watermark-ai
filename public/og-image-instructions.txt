# Open Graph Image Instructions

Since we can't directly create a PNG file through this interface, here are instructions for creating the Open Graph image:

## Image Specifications
- Dimensions: 1200 x 630 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Background color: #4A6BFF (blue)

## Design Elements
1. Background: Solid blue (#4A6BFF) filling the entire canvas
2. Logo: A simple watermark icon in white at the center
3. Text: "GPT 워터마크 탐지기" in large, white, sans-serif font
4. Subtitle: "AI 생성 콘텐츠 식별 도구" in smaller white font
5. Visual elements: Subtle watermark pattern in the background with lower opacity

## Steps to Create
1. Create a new 1200x630 pixel canvas in a design tool (Figma, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Fill the background with #4A6BFF
3. Add the text and visual elements as described above
4. Export as og-image.png
5. Place the file in the public directory

## Alternative
You can also use an online Open Graph image generator and customize it with the text and colors mentioned above.

## Placement
Once created, place the og-image.png file in the public directory of the project.
