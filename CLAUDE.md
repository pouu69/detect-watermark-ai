## Project Architecture

### Overview

The "watermark-ai" project is a web application designed to detect and remove hidden watermarks in text generated by AI models like ChatGPT and Bard. The application is accessible at [gpt-scan.org](https://gpt-scan.org).

### Core Components

1. **WatermarkDetector.tsx**: Processes text input and implements the UI for watermark detection
2. **WatermarkRemover.tsx**: Implements the UI for watermark removal functionality
3. **ResultDisplay.tsx**: Shows detection and removal results with visualizations
4. **watermarkUtils.ts**: Core utility functions that implement watermark detection and removal algorithms

### Watermark Detection Logic

The application detects three main types of invisible watermarks:

1. **Zero Width Characters**: Invisible characters like zero-width spaces (`\u200B`)
2. **Special Spaces**: Special Unicode space characters that look like regular spaces
3. **Emoji Variant Selectors**: Special characters that can modify the appearance of emojis

### Key Features

- Detection of multiple watermark types
- Visual highlighting of watermark locations in text
- GPT authorship probability calculation
- Removal of detected watermarks
- Statistical analysis with charts (word frequency, sentence patterns)

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: SCSS
- **Visualization**: Chart.js and React-Chartjs-2
- **Internationalization**: i18next (Korean and English)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (S3, CloudFront, Route53, ACM)
- **IaC**: Terraform for AWS infrastructure

## Deployment

The application is deployed to AWS using GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the main branch:

1. Terraform provisions/updates AWS infrastructure
2. Vite builds the React application
3. Built assets are deployed to S3
4. CloudFront cache is invalidated to refresh content

## Code Style Guidelines

- TypeScript is used with appropriate interfaces and types
- Functional components with React hooks
- 2-space indentation, no semicolons
- Comprehensive comments for complex logic
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- File/variable/function naming: camelCase
- Classes/Interfaces/Types: PascalCase
